I came across the first step of the challenge through watching a video on [OpenUptheCloud](https://github.com/openupthecloud/cloud-resume-challenge/blob/parameterise-sam/1-setup-aws.md)'s cloud resume challenge by [Lou Bichard](https://loujaybee.com/).


In addition to that, massive shout out to Lou, his [OpenUptheCloud](https://openupthecloud.com/),is a social-enterprise dedicated to helping you get started and grow your career in cloud and I am still learning a lot from his experiences, advices and even some really good cloud books!!!.
